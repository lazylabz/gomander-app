A simple GUI to launch, monitor and organize your commands. Because nobody should have to juggle 12+ terminal windows just to run their project.

We started building this for ourselves when we got tired of the daily terminal chaos, and figured other developers might find it useful too.

## Main Features

- Keep all your commands organized by project so you never lose track of what belongs where
- Bundle related commands into groups and run them all at once
- See what's running, what's not, and check the logs without switching windows
- Configure working directories however you want - use relative or absolute paths, whatever fits your workflow
- Export and import project configurations to get your whole team on the same page
- Works on macOS, Linux and Windows

## Known Issues
### TUI support
Right now commands that use TUI (e.g. ngrok) are not supported, as that require PTY support and the current code relies on commands with stdout

## macOS Users - Important Notice

**‚ö†Ô∏è Code Signing Disclaimer**

Since Gomander is a new project, we haven't purchased the $100 USD Apple Developer certificate required to sign the application. This means macOS will show a warning that the app is "damaged" or from an "unidentified developer."

**To use Gomander on macOS, you'll need to manually remove it from quarantine:**

If you downloaded the .app directly:
```bash
sudo xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /PATH/TO/YOUR/GOMANDER.app
```

If you installed via the DMG (most common):
```bash
sudo xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/gomander.app
```

This is a one-time process (every time you install a new release üòÇ). Once you run this command, Gomander will launch normally.

## Third-Party API Integration

Gomander provides a REST API that enables integration with third-party applications and tools. This API allows you to interact with commands and command groups programmatically.

### API Discovery

When Gomander starts, it automatically launches the API server on an available port in the range 9001-9100. To discover the API:

1. Send a GET request to any port in this range with the path `/discovery`
2. The first port that responds with a 200 OK status and the following JSON payload is the active Gomander API endpoint:
   ```json
   {
     "app": "Gomander"
   }
   ```

### Available Endpoints

The API provides the following main endpoints:

- **GET /commands** - List all commands with their status (running/stopped)
- **POST /commands/{id}/run** - Run a specific command
- **POST /commands/{id}/stop** - Stop a running command
- **GET /command-groups** - List all command groups with information about running commands
- **POST /command-groups/{id}/run** - Run all commands in a group
- **POST /command-groups/{id}/stop** - Stop all running commands in a group

### OpenAPI Specification

For complete API documentation, refer to the OpenAPI specification file located at:

```
/cmd/gomander/thirdpartyserver/openapi.yaml
```

This specification provides detailed information about all endpoints, request parameters, response formats, and possible error codes.
