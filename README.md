A simple GUI to launch, monitor and organize your commands. Because nobody should have to juggle 12+ terminal windows just to run their project.

We started building this for ourselves when we got tired of the daily terminal chaos, and figured other developers might find it useful too.

## Main Features

- Keep all your commands organized by project so you never lose track of what belongs where
- Bundle related commands into groups and run them all at once
- See what's running, what's not, and check the logs without switching windows
- Configure working directories however you want - use relative or absolute paths, whatever fits your workflow
- Export and import project configurations to get your whole team on the same page
- Works on macOS, Linux and Windows

## Known Issues
### TUI support
Right now commands that use TUI (e.g. ngrok) are not supported, as that require PTY support and the current code relies on commands with stdout

## macOS Users - Important Notice

**‚ö†Ô∏è Code Signing Disclaimer**

Since Gomander is a new project, we haven't purchased the $100 USD Apple Developer certificate required to sign the application. This means macOS will show a warning that the app is "damaged" or from an "unidentified developer."

**To use Gomander on macOS, you'll need to manually remove it from quarantine:**

If you downloaded the .app directly:
```bash
sudo xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /PATH/TO/YOUR/GOMANDER.app
```

If you installed via the DMG (most common):
```bash
sudo xattr -d com.apple.quarantine /Applications/gomander.app
```

This is a one-time process (every time you install a new release üòÇ). Once you run this command, Gomander will launch normally.
